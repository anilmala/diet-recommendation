This project aims to assist individuals in monitoring their health by checking their blood pressure or diabetes levels and comparing these measurements to a pre-existing dataset to identify which health risk cluster they fall into. Based on the cluster, the system will provide recommendations for nearby hospitals and the best doctors specializing in diabetes and blood pressure management.
